# How to build it? or run it?
To run it on localhost, you go to the folder, open a CMD. then write ```npm install```, after installing everything do ```npm run dev```, after this you can open your browser and write ```localhost:3000```.

To build it, you simply do all of the steps above, expect that you run ```npm run build```, after this you will find a folder called ```out``` in the repo's folder. to disable static building please remove this ```output: 'export',``` from the ```next.config.js```.
